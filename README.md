## History

On August 6, 2025, while playing Enter the Gungeon, I wondered: could I modify some game files to get more cash? However, Enter the Gungeon uses Unity as its game engine and relies on binary serialization. That meant I couldn't simply change a few variables. So, I asked an AI for advice, and it suggested reading the game's RAM directly - just like Cheat Engine does.
